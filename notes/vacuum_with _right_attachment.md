## Vacuum Using the Right Attachments

To reduce scraping when using a vacuum, it is important to use the appropriate attachments for the specific surface you are cleaning. Here are some tips:

### _Hardwood floors_
Use a hardwood floor attachment that has soft bristles or felt pads to avoid scratching the surface. Avoid using the beater bar attachment on hardwood floors.

### _Carpets_
Use a beater bar attachment to agitate the fibers and remove dirt and debris. However, if your carpet is delicate or has a loose weave, use a gentle suction-only attachment to avoid damaging it.

### _Upholstery_
Use a upholstery attachment with soft bristles to gently remove dirt and dust. Avoid using the beater bar attachment on upholstery, as it can damage the fabric.

### _Drapes and Curtains_
Use a soft brush attachment to remove dust and dirt. Be sure to adjust the suction setting to prevent the fabric from being pulled into the vacuum.

### _Stairs_
Use a stair attachment with a narrow profile and soft bristles to clean the steps without causing damage.

Remember to always check the manufacturer's recommendations for your vacuum and attachments, and to test any new attachments on a small, inconspicuous area before using them on a larger scale.
