## Enhanced Cleaning Process

### Step 1: Prepare
Proper preparation can help you and your team clean more efficiently and more safely. Make sure you:

- [ ] Ventilate the space before and during cleaning when possible
- [ ] Use disinfectants approved by your local regulatory agencies for use against COVID-19
- [ ] Always read the directions and warnings on your cleaning products carefully
- [ ] Wash or disinfect your hands

### Step 2: Clean
Cleaning is removing dust and dirt from surfaces, such as floors and countertops. Make sure you:

- [ ] Sweep, vacuum, dust, and/or mop areas before sanitizing
- [ ] Wash dishes and laundry on the highest heat setting possible
- [ ] Wipe down hard surfaces with soap and water

### Step 3: Sanitize
Sanitizing is when you use chemicals to reduce bacteria on surfaces such as doorknobs and TV remotes. Be sure to:

- [ ] Spray high-touch surfaces in each room with an approved disinfectant spray
- [ ] Let the disinfectant stand for the length of time specified on the product label
- [ ] Allow the surface to air-dry

### Step 4: Check
Once you’re done sanitizing, it’s a good idea to make sure you’ve not missed anything. Be sure to:

- [ ] Refer to the best practices in each room-by-room checklist in your handbook to make sure you haven’t missed a spot
- [ ] Share these best practices with your hosting team and cleaning professionals

### Step 5: Reset
To help prevent cross-contamination, it's important to finish cleaning and sanitizing a room before replacing items for the next guest:

- [ ] Wash your hands before replacing guest supplies, linens, and cleaning kits
- [ ] Safely dispose of or wash cleaning supplies and protective gear
- [ ] Don’t re-enter a room once it’s been sanitized
- [ ] Clean your equipment between each turnover
