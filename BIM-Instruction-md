BIM (Buidling Information Modeling) provides the base for digital transformtion in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. 
It is the holistic process of creating and managing information for a built asset.
It is an intellegent model-based process that connects AEC professionals so they can more efficently design, builde and operate buildings and infrastructure. 
With BIM designers can create 3D digital models that includes data (design elements) associated with physical and functional characteristics.
It helps to gain fatser buy-in and approvals with realistic visualization.
Also the owners can use BIM for predictive maintenance, assest tracking and facilities management and for future renovation or deconstruction projects.
It will reduce project risk, improved timelines and cost savings and provide better project outcomes.
BIM ensures consistency and coordination through the buildings life cycle, from desihn to recycling. 
BIM make it easier to understand the realtion between space, materials and system.
Softwares used for BIM are Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Navisworks, Autodesk BIM 360, Sketchup, ArchiCAD, Vectorworks Architect. 

Building Informition Management:-
Building Information Management or BIM is the process of designing, constructing and operating a building with the use of electronic object-orientated information, i.e. Building Information Models.

BIM is an acronym for Building Information Modeling or Building Information Management. It is a highly collaborative process that allows architects, engineers, real estate developers, contractors, manufacturers, and other construction professionals to plan, design, and construct a structure or building within one 3D mod
